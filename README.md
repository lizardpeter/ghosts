# Ghosts: a collection of information and modified files

The goal of this project is to provide a fully open-source Call of Duty: Ghosts client with support for online multiplayer, modification of protected DVARs (like cg_fovscale), modification of FPS and FOV beyond the hard-coded limits, and Discord rich presence.

Not everything in this project will be created by me (I don't have the time). Instead, I will be taking various open-source components and making some changes myself (in addition to adding my own code) to hopefully achieve the desired final product.
